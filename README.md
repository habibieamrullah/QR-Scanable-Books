Scan QR to read a book - in other words: Online ebook QRCode generator

A simple online books library written in PHP enables you to upload pdf files and share them by showing QR Code images that automatically generated for you. Then, for example, you can print the QRCode within a flyer or a banner and place it on public places, then people scan it then they will directly gain access to the ebook on their mobile web browsers.
